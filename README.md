# JARVIS
This is a desktop voice assisstant which assissts its master in doing tasks by recognizing his voice with the help of speech recognition library and it replies by pronouncing the results with the help of pyttsx library(which uses google search engine). 
JARVIS can send the email for you, it can play music, search any wikipedia result, open any specific website, can tell you the time/date and also it wishes you. Additionally the possibilities are countless like running/scheduling other programs with it.
